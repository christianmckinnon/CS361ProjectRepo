# Portfolio Project for OSU CS 361 Software Engineering I: Stockachoo

This is my full-stack web application, "Stockachoo," for the OSU CS 361 Portfolio Project written using NodeJS, React, JSX, and CSS. This application includes functional Login, My Portfolio, FAQ, and Summary pages with a user-friendly navigation bar at the top. On the My Portfolio page, a user can input 3 stock ticker symbols and generate an automated Portfolio Diversification Report based on stocks that are in the S&P 500 Index (March 2024).

Additionally, this application uses a microservice via the open-source messaging broker, RabbitMQ, coded by my teammate to send and receive requests from the sp500.csv.
