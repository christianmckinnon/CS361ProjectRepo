This is my Portfolio Project for CS 361 coded in JavaScript which allows a user to input 3 stocks and generate a Portfolio Diversification Report based on stocks that are in the S&P 500 in 2024.
This application also uses a microservice via RabbitMQ coded by my partner to send a receive requests from the sp500.csv
